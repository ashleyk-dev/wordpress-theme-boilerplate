### Do This First:
- put .gitignore in root dir
- rename the theme directory 
- search for __\<theme\>__ & replace it with your theme name
- search for __\<company\>__ & replace it with the name of the company
- search for __\<author\>__ & replace it with your name/email/github
- delete vendor scripts, vendor css files & theme supports you don't need/want
- delete the example page template if you don't need it (page-templates/example-template.php)
- commit your initial code before installing node modules and compiling css
- add your favicons/site.manifest files to the root or delete the links in the header
- rewrite readme

- all css compiles to style.css
- the 'Roboto' google font is enqueued by default
- __changes made directly to style.css will not persist__
- all css & sass code should go in the sass directory
- all sass files are imported into /assets/sass/style.scss
- this theme supports a primary menu and a footer menu 
- support for an example custom post type is commented out in functions.php
- this theme supports an [advanced custom fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) site options page (see functions.php)
